This repository contains a demo sample application and a workflow definition that signs and notarizes the software using the [macOS CryptoTokenKit](https://about.signpath.io/documentation/crypto-providers/macos) from [SignPath](https://about.signpath.io).

The sample workflow can be found at [.github/workflows/sign-and-notarize.yml](.github/workflows/sign-and-notarize.yml).
